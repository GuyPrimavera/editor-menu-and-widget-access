Allow and control Editor and Shop Manager access to the menus, widgets and appearance menu, plus other menus and adminbar items.
## Description

This open source and lightweight plugin allows users with the role **Editor** or **Shop Manager** to access the **Menus** and **Widgets** areas of the Appearance menu in WordPress' admin area. 

This is a common task that would be useful for clients to manage themselves to give them more control over their website's content.

This plugin also gives access to the **Customize** submenu and other theme options, but these can be hidden through the options page at **Appearance > Editor Access** if you wish.

You can now select other menus to hide from Editors and Shop Managers (e.g. Custom theme or plugin options pages).

### Features

* **Allow access** to Customize, Menus and Widgets for Editors and Shop Managers.
* **Theme Options** remain hidden from these user roles.
* **Hide custom options pages** from these users (if your theme/plugin has a custom settings page you wish to hide).
* **Hide any other menus** or submenus. Simply select which menus you wish to hide.
